## Programming Assignment 1 - Binary Search Algorithm ##
### Instructions for use ###
To compile, you have 2 options:
1. Navigate into the src directory and execute `rustc main.rs`, then execute like a normal executable.
 The program is designed to accept the name of the input file as the first (and only) command line argument.
2. From the top of the `program1` directory, execute `cargo run -- [path_to_input_file]`. This will
 compile the code, install any needed dependencies and run the code with the given arguments (after the `--`).
 I suggest using this second method.
